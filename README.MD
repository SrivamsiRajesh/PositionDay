# PositionDay

## Introduction

In today's competitive job market, finding the right opportunity can be a daunting task. As a high school senior myself, I understand the challenges faced by job seekers who spend countless hours scrolling through job websites, often with limited success. Some platforms even require payment just to view job postings, and many job seekers lack the necessary skills to secure the positions they desire.

PositionDay is a CLI-based program designed to simplify the job search process. It helps you find relevant job opportunities, identify the skills required for those jobs, and even provides an AI-powered career coach for those who prefer a more interactive experience. Built with the needs of programmers and developers in mind, PositionDay leverages the power of the command line interface to make job searching efficient and effective.
